# Cobbleloots ALPHA-2.0.9

> **REMEMBER**: Alpha versions may contain bugs and **unfinished features**. Use them at your own risk. If you find any issues, please report them on the Discord server.

## Changes
- Updated the Creative Mode tab icon to use a Master Ball texture for better visual representation.
- Updated the default Loot Ball texture to use the Strange Ball texture when no specific texture is set for debugging purposes.
    - If you encounter a Strange Ball, it indicates that the Loot Ball is not properly configured or has missing data.

## Fixes
- Fixed a bug where the game would crash when trying to spawn a Loot Ball in a chunk with an invalid section index (like the void or above the world height limit).
