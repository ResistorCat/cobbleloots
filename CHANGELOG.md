# Cobbleloots ALPHA-2.0.2

> **IMPORTANT**: Alpha versions of the mod may contain bugs and **unfinished features**. Use them at your own risk. If you find any issues, please report them on the GitHub repository.

## Changes
- Added an offset for loot ball spawns and generations, so they don't spawn on block borders.

## Fixes
- Fixed a bug where the mod would crash when trying to open a loot ball with mods that need access to loot ball items like the Jade mod.
