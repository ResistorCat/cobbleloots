# Cobblemon: CobbleLoots

Cobbleloots is a mod for Cobblemon that adds different ways to obtain items based on the original Pokémon video games.

> **Note**: This mod replaces my previous mod `Cobblemon: Loot Balls`, but it is not compatible with the old loot balls from the other mod, so I suggest backing up items from previous worlds.

> **IMPORTANT**: Alpha versions of the mod may contain bugs and **unfinished features**. Use them at your own risk. If you find any issues, please report them on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ResistorCat/cobbleloots/issues).

# Features

## Loot Balls 💎
Based on my previous work on the **Cobblemon mod: Loot Balls**, these balls contain useful items for the player.

> **Note**: The loot balls from the previous mod (versions b1.x or older) are not compatible with this one!

### Obtaining Loot Balls (WIP)
- **Generation**: Loot balls can be found in the world. Some of them are specific to biomes, while others are more common.
- **Spawning**: Overtime, loot balls will spawn in the world around random players.

## Mapmaking 🗺️
Check out the [documentation](https://resistorcat.github.io/cobbleloots/) to learn how to use the mod objects and features in your custom maps. If you still have questions, feel free to ask on my discord server.

### Custom Loot Balls 🎁
Create custom loot balls with different items and properties using the new Loot Ball Data system. You can customize the loot table, texture, sources, rarity, biomes and more. Some of these features are not yet implemented, but you can write the data for future use.

## Mod configuration ⚙️
You can customize some of the mod features in the config file. The config file is located in the `config/cobbleloots` folder of your Minecraft instance, and is named `cobbleloots.yaml`. You can edit it with any text editor.

# Planned Features

## Other Sources 🎣
More ways to obtain loot balls in survival mode, such as fishing, archaeology and more.

## Loot Ball Timers ⏲️
Set timers for loot balls, and customize the time intervals for people to claim them.

## Commands 🛠️
Commands to help mapmakers and server owners to manage the mod features.

## Hidden Items 🔍
Inspired by the original Pokémon games, Hidden Items are invisible objects scattered across the world, waiting to be discovered.

## Fake Items 🪤
Be aware that some objects may not be what they appear to be. Pokémon will sometimes disguise themselves as objects in order to trick you.

# Looking for the old mod? (Loot Balls)

If you are looking for the old mod, you can still find the files and docs in the [Github Repository for Loot Balls](https://github.com/ResistorCat/cobblemon-loot-balls). Keep in mind that the old mod is only compatible with `Cobblemon 1.5.x` versions and is no longer maintained.
