# Cobblemon: CobbleLoots

> **Note**: This mod replaces my previous mod `Cobblemon: Loot Balls`, but it is not compatible with the old loot balls from the other mod, so I suggest backing up items from previous worlds.

Cobbleloots is a mod for Cobblemon that adds different ways to obtain items based on the original Pokémon video games.

# Features

## Loot Balls 💎
Based on my previous work on the Cobblemon mod: Loot Balls, these balls contain useful items for the player and can be found throughout your adventure in the world.

# Planned Features

## Hidden Items 🔍
Inspired by the original Pokémon games, Hidden Items are invisible objects scattered across the world, waiting to be discovered.

## Fake Items 🪤
Be aware that some objects may not be what they appear to be. Pokémon will sometimes disguise themselves as objects in order to trick you.
