# Looking for the old mod? (Loot Balls)

If you are looking for the old mod, you can still find the files and docs in the [Github Repository for Loot Balls](https://github.com/ResistorCat/cobblemon-loot-balls). Keep in mind that the old mod is only compatible with `Cobblemon 1.5.x` versions and is no longer maintained.
